Andrew Mead - The Complete Node.js Developer Course

## Description

This is the Task Manager API application featured in Andrew Mead's Node.js Developer Course, but in **Typescript**

---
⚠️ Need HELP ⚠️


The app is in a working state BUT
- I have used `// @ts-ignore` in 2 places in `src/models/user.ts`
- There are some type `any`s used in various places, need help removing all of them
---
## Setup

1. Create a `./config/dev.env` file with the following variables
```
- PORT
- SENDGRID_API_KEY
- MONGODB_URL
- JWT_SECRET
```
2. `npm install` followed by `npm run dev` should get you up and running
